# LibMythicPlus

A World of Warcraft (WoW) Addon designed to facilitate development of _other_ addons that deal with Mythic+ or Keystones. This library helps provide 
a more consistent, normalized, easy-to-use API for retrieiving Mythic+ information, responding to events, and handling scenarios that Blizzard's API 
does not easily account for. Please check out the section below "Notable Features" for a more detailed look at what this library provides over 
Blizzard's standard APIs.

## Installation

Though LibMythicPlus is geared primarily toward addon developers you should install LibMythicPlus using whatever normal WoW addon installation procedures 
you typically take. This library should be available though all common WoW addon distribution methods. If this addon is not available on your distribution 
method of choice please raise on issue on this repo.
